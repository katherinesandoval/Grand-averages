# Grand-averages

In this interesting and challenging project there are three basic objectives that coincide with determining the averages 
of people and quizzes of a class. The first objective of this project is to calculate the total average for each of the 
students’ quizzes as well as the quizzes’ total average.  The second objective of this project consists of dropping the 
highest and the lowest scores for both the quizzes and the students in order to calculate the total average of the reminding 
scores.  The final objective of this project is to calculate the grand averages which are the total averages for all the 
averages already found.  Everything in this project is based on the information given of a class’ test scores.  In order to 
achieve the objectives of this project, it is necessary to have some basic knowledge of the important concepts of   strings, 
functions, while and for loops, two dimensional arrays, converter function from string to integer, and insertion sort function.
